		<name>10 Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.

Players start out as a high school team. Games consists of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game, and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the players score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. 

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or go four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.


In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.</desc>

		<name>Adven'chuta!</name>
		<desc>Taking its title from the English word "adventure" and the squeak of a mouse; "chu", Adven'chuta is an old school adventure game, not far from Atari's old Adventure.

As a mouse, you must get around a dungeon populated by dangerous frogs and spiders. There are jars which may contain both treasures and danger, and which block the way. You have an inventory, but it can only contain one item at any time. Take care in what you pick up and leave behind. Juggling the inventory becomes a basic skill since items will block the narrow passages of the dungeon. Basic items are keys, for opening the door to the next dungeon, as well as cheese, which is good for the adventuring mouse's stamina. The dungeon must be completed within a set time or it's game over.

Control the mouse with the cursor keys, and use the following keys to issue commands:

B: Crush jar
T: Take item
O: Open door
P: Leave item behind
E: Eat cheese
K: Kick frog</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Aleste 2.It was released as a free game in Compile's now defunct WOOMB magazine. It is also known as Aleste Special, because it was released in the Disc Station 4 Aku Gau disc in Autumn.

Unlike Aleste 1, you are not controlling a spaceship, but instead you're controlling a robot. However, like Aleste, you can shoot enemies, enemies can shoot you, collect power ups, and defeat bosses at the end of a level. However, new to this game is the ability to jump over holes in the ground. This adds a new challenge to the game. In some levels, there are even obstacles like cars that you have to avoid. Power ups range from one that clones yourself and can fire lasers with you, one that replaces your default laser with shurikens. One replaces your default weapon and instead shoots red targets that go in a zig-zag. This laser has a possiblity of shooting enemies. The kinds of power-ups are marked by the color of their box-containers and the Japanese letter on them.</desc>

		<desc>In our universe matter and anti-matter co-exist with each other. However, prevalence of anti-matter may create chaos and eventually disrupt the normal flow of things. In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.

Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up. The protagonist is equipped with a default single shot and has protective orbs revolving around that damage nearby enemies. The weapon can be enhanced (rapid fire, three-way fire, etc.) by collecting randomly descending power-ups. The player controls the male incarnation of the protagonist initially, but later switches to the female one.</desc>

		<desc>Agent Captain Blitztek has to find a way through enemy territory to prevent the Axtoatles from taking control of the world. 

Aquattack is an action game with four levels which partly have varying gameplay mechanics. In level one and two, the player mans a motor boat which needs to travel a certain distance from left to right. Of course there is a lot of enemy opposition which needs to be avoided. Some enemies can be shot while others are out of reach. Fuel is limited and needs to replenished by collecting refreshments dropped by allied planes. Level three is similar; the player uses a hang glider now. There are different enemies to fight and no fuel to collect. In level four, there is a guarded energy field to cross in order to bring four bombs to the other side. However, only one bomb can be transported at once and there is a time limit.

After beating all four levels, they loop with more difficult enemies and faster playing speed.  The player can take nine hits and the overall goal is to earn as many points as possible before the unavoidable final death occurs.</desc>

		<name>Arctic</name>
		<desc>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

Howerver, when Banutracus returned to his planet he killed the father and re-established his hold. One Cooligan Gea saw the evil nature of Banutracus and escaped with the father's only daughter Neshah to one of the great ruined Eletrian cities. There, they had a son. When the boy grew to be a strong young man, one of the Cooligan soldiers discovered their hideout and killed his escaped parents. From that day, the boy swore vengeance on Banutracus and to eventually restore peace to the planet.?</desc>

		<desc>In Back to the Future, 80s teen Marty McFly is mistakenly send 30 years into the past where he disrupts his own parents from meeting. Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.

LJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.

Street running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).</desc>

		<name>Backgammon</name>
		<desc>This is the game backgammon and its variant, acey deucey. For backgammon, the standard rules are used. As they are long and complex, if you want to see those rules, look in this manual.

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:

All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.

No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.

A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.

After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.

If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Difficulty switches

Right:

A=computer rolls dice for you

B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers

Left:

A=computer sets up the board for you

B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

Game variations

Games 1, 3, 5, and 7 are one player

Games 2, 4, 6, and 8 are two player

		<name>Balance</name>
		<desc>This German game of dexterity delivers what the title promises. Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the "A to B" routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate.

Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.</desc>

		<desc>Banana is a puzzle game based on the Mole Mole games, where you have to navigate a mole through various levels, making it to the exit. The task is not as simple as it sounds. First, the mole cannot jump or climb up unless there is a ladder nearby. So you have to plan your route ahead, otherwise you can get stuck at the bottom. Second, boulders will fall and block your way. And third, you have a wife. You should first find her, and then lead her securely to the exit. The wife will sometimes make things harder, forcing you to find alternate ways to the exit. But sometimes she'll also be helpful, pushing away boulders and clearing the road for you. 

On every level, there is also various food scattered around, primarily bananas. You'll be able to complete a level if you have gathered enough of those fruits. You'll also gain superpowers from bananas that will allow you to skip level sections that you find too difficult. The entire game is played only with the four directional buttons. There are no enemies and you cannot die - although you can get irrevocably stuck, in which case you'll have to restart a level.</desc>

		<name>Bank Panic</name>
		<desc>As a gunslinger, it's your job to protect a bank from bandits while taking care not to shoot innocent customers. The bank has 12 doors in front of 12 teller windows, with only three doors visible at a time. Shooting is done simply by pressing one of the three buttons to shoot the left, middle or right door. The player can move his viewpoint left and right to reveal new doors. People only appear behind the doors that are currently visible on screen, except for the rare outlaws who will pop up to steal a cash deposit from a teller window the player isn't watching. Indicators at the top of the screen show how much time it will take before someone will show up at a door. 

If a bandit appears behind a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot him before he shoots you. If you shoot him too early (i.e. before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair and gives very little score, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. Sometimes a bandit will stick dynamite on one of the doors. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you take too long, the bomb explodes (even if it's offscreen) and you lose a life. 

If you're lucky, a customer will appear behind the door and deposit a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. Sometimes a bandit will suddenly take the customer hostage and replace them in the door. 

At other times, a cowboy will appear with a stack of hats. Shooting off all the hats before the door closes grants a cash deposit and a big score bonus. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins. 

There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, there is a time limit.</desc>

		<desc>The TurboGrafx-16 version of Batman: The Video Game is a top-down maze-like game, somewhat similar to Pac-Man or Bomberman.

The game consists of five stages based on the movie: the Streets of Gotham, Flugelheim Museum, AXIS Chemical Factory, the Parade and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker. The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting "smilex" components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed.

Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.</desc>

		<name>Beach-Head</name>
		<desc>A dictator took the control of a fortress on the island of Kuhn-Lin.

The player's mission is to storm the island and recapture it. This takes place over the course of six different sequences. The first sequence is Aerial Reconnaissance, where the fleet must be moved directly past the enemy or into a hidden passage to trigger another, optional stage. In this Hidden Passage sequence, the player will have to maneuver around mines and torpedoes. Successfully completing it gives a surprise advantage in the following General Quarters sequence, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft.

The next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to hit enemy ships before they inflict too much damage and eventually sink the player's own vessels.  Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. 
Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.

The port for C16 and Plus/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.</desc>

The penguins start on opposite sides, separated by walls, bricks, and other obstacles. You take control of one of the penguins. The other makes exactly the same movements as you, but in the opposite direction. So if for example you see an enemy to the left of the penguin you are not controlling, you have to fire to the right in order to hit it. You have to reach the top of the level in such a way that the two penguins will arrive at the top square at the same time, coming from opposite sides. Enemies such as spiders will put web on your way or attack you. You can kill them for points. There are various power-ups that appear randomly on the levels. You should also be careful not to run out of time.</desc>

Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom line, it is Game Over.</desc>

You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</desc>

To find them, the player needs to look for the correct fraction pictures, matching what is shown at the top of the screen, while a radar shows the layout of floors at the bottom. Incorrect fractions can be knocked down for scoring points, but this leaves holes in the floors. When the player doesn't manage to jump over these and falls down far enough or several times, the game will end. There is also a time limit to look out for, if the clock reaches zero the Fraction Elevator of the current floor cannot be reached, and the player has to jump down a floor to be able to try again.</desc>

In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...

In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple ? just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.</desc>

In the game, ZED raids Altile to fight the Xantho empire and destroy its leader, Xur. ZED deploys bombs to clear a path through rocks, walls, and forests, while killing enemies and collecting items. Some gameplay elements resemble those of Bomberman (1983).

RoboWarrior comprises five level formats. In one, the player must obtain a key before the time limit expires. In another, the key is unavailable until the player acquires a crystal or chalice. Some levels are cast in darkness, rendering obstructions invisible unless the player has a lit lamp. Still other levels are mazes in which a player must find and blast-through weak points in walls to proceed. Periodically, a player engages a boss level.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.

The first of the Bomberman series, Bomberman is a single-player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, the player only has a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (four directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. The goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Break In</name>
		<desc>As the title implies, this is a game about breaking into banks, as well as a Break-Out clone.

Each level is a bank, consisting of several rooms. You can only leave a room after your ball hits a key. As a burgler, you are symbolised by a pair of eyes, on top of which a paddle rests. Similarly to Woody Pop, parts of the bottom of the screen is covered up, so that you need not guard the ball as much as in other games. Unlike most Break-Out clones, you can move freely over the entire screen so as to hit the ball at the perfect spot. If you miss the ball and it passes through the void at the bottom, it falls back into the earlier rooms, just like in the Amiga classic, Poing. If you catch it there, you can send it back to the room your were in. In the last room of each bank, you should hit the money that is in there, before you hit the square with a calculator, which will calculate your score for that bank. Later vaults feature a bell which must not be hit, or it will wake a guardian that will hunt you across the screen.

As in all post-Arkanoids, powerups are available, in the shape of a circle that bounces across the screen, all the while changing colours. Depending on which colour it is when you pick it up with your paddle, you get one bonus out of a range which corresponds to the basics of most games in the genre, such as wider paddle, sticky paddle, multiball and firepower.</desc>

		<name>Break Out</name>
		<desc>Break-Out is a Break Out variant. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must prevent a ball from hitting the floor and at the same time destroy bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with said ball. Each destroyed brick scores points.

There are some subtle differences compared to the original game. The paddle is controlled slightly differently. Pressing either the left or right direction with Keypad 4 or 6 respectively moves the paddle in that direction, and the paddle keeps moving until it hits the side or the player presses 5.

When the ball hits a corner of a brick it will not bounce back and instead break through multiple rows, this makes it easier to get the ball above the rows of bricks. Because the game is written in BASIC the ball can only travel at a 45 degree angle, causing it to leave quickly as well. 

The player starts with 9 lives with which to score points. There's no keeping of high-scores.</desc>

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.</desc>

		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders.  There are 20 areas to be completed.

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

		<name>Burger Time</name>
		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step over every burger ingredient. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also "bump" any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.

Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.</desc>

		<desc>Car Jamboree is a conversion of the arcade game with the same name.
In this game, which can be played by one or two players, you control a car and compete with three other cars in an squared arena. Your goal is to destroy the other three cars by crashing into them on the side. A head-on collision has no effect.
When all three other cars have been taken out of competition you advance to the next level.
In some levels the arena can contain a ramp, which can be used to jump on other cars or a pond in the middle in which you can try to push the other cars to take them out of the competition.

All this has to be done before you run out of fuel. If any fuel left then you'll receive bonus points.</desc>

The Monstas themselves hatch from eggs hanging from the ceilings and the Mightas push a rock that is used as the game's timer. The Monsta eggs have three phases:  if it's blue, it's completely harmless, if it's yellow it will pop within 10 seconds and if an egg turns red it will pop almost immediately.

Chack'n uses bombs to blow up the Monstas and their eggs and he also uses them to release the captured hearts from their cages. When the heart is released, it will fly up and destroy the separator block and reveal the exit to the level.

Most versions of the game contain 14 levels to play through, however the Famicom version only includes 9.</desc>

The components from which a car must be built are chassis, engine and coachwork, what of course must occur in the correct order. During your attempt to build cars you are pursued by hostile cars and tanks. When the first car is assembled entirely it then will change into a coin. Collecting that coin gives you temporarily invulnerability, so you can chase the hostile cars and tanks for bonuses.

		<name>Circus Charlie</name>
		<desc>You are Charlie, a member of a circus troupe. Your job is to please the crowd by performing five death-defying stunts:

Stunt #1: You and the lion must jump through several rings of fire. Remember to avoid the jugs that emit fire. You must do this for 100 meters.

Stunt #2: Walk the tightrope for 70 meters, avoiding the monkeys that get in your way. Jump the cyan monkeys for 500 points.

Stunt #3: Roll on a ball for 80 meters, jumping from ball to ball. You can move balls backwards if the target is too close to make a successful jump. Avoid contact with the ground.

Stunt #4: Ride a horse for 200 meters, bouncing on trampolines along the way. Be careful not to miss the jump or go over the tops of trampolines. You can speed up or slow down the horse.

Stunt #5: Finally, trapeze from swing to swing for 50 meters. If you miss, make sure that you land on the platforms below so you bounce back on a swing.

Once you have completed all five stunts, you have to do them again and hopefully, more points will be awarded.</desc>

		<path>./Columns (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Columns</name>
		<desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

The game doesn't let you modify any parameters - in fact the main (and only) menu only have two options: play and exit. At least the game saves the ten best scores in a high score table.

The goal is to trap your opponent's pieces between yours, turning them into your pieces. When there are no free spaces left, whoever has the most pieces wins.</desc>

		<desc>The subtitle "The moving puzzle game" should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.

There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. 

As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Courageous Perseus is one of the very first Action RPGs from Japan, being released one month before Hydlide and in the same month as Falcom's Dragon Slayer. However, while the other two have spawned successful series, Courageous Perseus has been mostly forgotten.

You play as the legendary hero Perseus who sets out to an island full of mythical beasts in order to save the Pleiades Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. Perseus starts with 2000HP, but his health is constantly being drained one point per second. Enemies are attacked simply by bumping into them while holding the Space bar pressed.

Story 

Located in the south of the ocean is an island, where at one time resided a flower garden inhabited by three Goddesses of beauty named Maia, Celaeno, and Asterope. However, the island was invaded by a Gorgon and her followers. The Goddesses entrusted the Twelve Constellations to the residents of the flower garden, but they were found by the Gorgon and their hearts were turned evil.

The sorrowful voices of the Goddesses reached Zeus in the world of the heaven, and his tears became rain that wetted the ground. Zeus called the Hero Perseus, and a sacred shield and sword were bestowed on him by the Goddess of Wisdom Athena and the Messager God Hermes. Perseus then headed of to the southern island.

		<desc>The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.
All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state. The game's designer, graphic designer, and music composer, Tomo Furukawa, would go on to become the vocalist of the band Guniw Tools.The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship "evolves" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.</desc>

		<name>Decathlon</name>
		<desc>Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

In a full decathlon, a points table is filled in as the events progress.</desc>

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.</desc>

There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Slayer II - Xanadu (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Slayer 2 - Xanadu</name>
		<desc>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.

Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.

Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.

Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Slayer 4 - Drasle Family</name>
		<desc>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.
The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.

The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</desc>

In Romancia: Dragon Slayer Jr., you are a young warrior whom the king sends on a mission to rescue a lost princess. You must leave the town and enter the dreadful monster-infested catacombs in order to complete your quest.

The game is a departure from Dragon Slayer RPG-oriented gameplay style. It tends more towards medieval-themed platformer action. The hero has hit points, can buy items and weapons, use magic, and stay in inns to recover health. However, instead of receiving experience points and becoming stronger, you simply must attack quicker (by bumping into your opponent on platform levels) and jump higher.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Slayer</name>
		<desc>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.

The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.</desc>

		<name>Druid</name>
		<desc>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. 

The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. 

The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. 

On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. 

The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health. </desc>

		<desc>Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon.  The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale.  However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</desc>

		<name>Eagle Fighter</name>
		<desc>Eagle Fighter is a basic vertical shooter with a 3D effect.
You control a space craft that has to shoot and kill the alien invaders.
What this game makes different from many other shooters is that before you can shoot the aliens you have to get your space craft airborne and it must be in air before the end of the runway!
Once airborne, you can shoot all aliens. But remember, there is only a limited supply of fuel on board! You must shoot all aliens before you run out of fuel.
After you've shot all aliens you have to get your space craft back on the ground to refuel for another mission.</desc>

		<name>Eggerland Mystery</name>
		<desc>The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. You play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored red. It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.
You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.
There are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).</desc>

		<path>./Elevator Action (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Elevator Action</name>
		<desc>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.

Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:
Shooting them with his gun.
Kicking them by jumping onto them.
Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.
Crushing them with an elevator.
Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.

While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. 

Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.

Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.

If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</desc>

		<desc>F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 is a top down Formula One Racing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released for the MSX in Japan and Europe in 1987. The game engine is very similar to Konami's Road Fighter. It also features Konami's custom sound chip called Konami SCC (a five-channel chip that compliments the three-channel PSG chip of the MSX computer system, or in other words, a sound custom chip that brings five voices more to the three voices of the PSG sound chip on the system), and great MSX1 graphics to go with it. It was one of the first ROM on MSX with this sound feature. Together with its "3D" spinoff (F-1 Spirit: 3D Special), F-1 Spirit: The Way To Formula-1 was the most extended racing game Konami released for the MSX.</desc>

		<name>Fantasy Zone II - The Tears of Opa-Opa</name>
		<desc>In the past, the courageous hero Opa-Opa saved the Fantasy Zone from the invading Nenon forces, but his victory came at a price as he was forced to fight his own father who led the invasion. It is now Space Year 1432, 10 years after that battle, and the Nenon forces are once again spreading chaos through the Fantasy Zone. Opa-Opa must once again fly into the Fantasy Zone to rout the invasion. Similar to Defender, the player occupies a side-scrolling level that repeats indefinitely, and in which the player can freely travel left or right. Each zone contains several "bases" that serve as primary targets. New to the sequel are "warps" hidden behind certain bases that allow the player to travel between different zones. Each level has at least three zones, and when all of the bases have been cleared in all of the zones of a level, the player can travel through the warp to the boss. Boss fights do not allow for free travel as the main stages do, and force the player to face the boss or face a particular direction. Bosses are generally very large and change color to reflect damage taken. The final stage is a "boss rush" in which the player must fight a succession of previous bosses before fighting the final boss. There are two action buttons that correspond to two types of attacks, "fire" and "bomb". The fire attacks shoot horizontally, as in a typical shooter, and different variants can be purchased at shops. The bomb attacks are more powerful, and the basic bomb drops downward. Other variants have other behaviors and are limited in quantity. Shops, uncovered at key points, allow the player to purchase upgraded weapons, bombs, and speed, as well as extra lives.[8] Upgrades to Opa-Opa's speed (such as larger wings, or jet engines) are permanent as long as the player does not lose a life, but weapon upgrades are time-limited, and bombs limited in quantity. Items become increasingly expensive with subsequent purchases, encouraging the player to vary their purchases.</desc>

Red Stones are placed in key locations across the levels. They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed. Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone. Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</desc>

		<path>./Flash Point (Korea) (Unl).zip</path>
		<name>Flashpoint</name>
		<desc>Flash Point is inspired by the arcade game Robotron. The story is that an alien fleet landed in the capital city of the United World Nations and the player has to defend it for as long as possible using a tank.

The gameplay is divided in two main screens. The first screen is the city map, which shows the areas being attacked by the aliens as flashing points (hence the game's name). The areas will flash faster as time passes by, until they are completely destroyed or until the player moves to that area to defend it. Once the player reaches one of those areas, the game changes to the second screen, which shows the tank in the center of a green park area, with buildings around it. There are several aliens in this area, which will start homing the player, destroying the terrain in their way. The player has to destroy them as quick as possible, trying to save as much terrain (specially the central green area) as possible for a higher score. Once all aliens are destroyed, the player is sent back to the map screen to select another area. Moving in the map screen is faster on streets, slower on other ground types.

The tank is controlled using both joysticks, one for movement and one for shooting in all eight possible directions. The game was released with a frame to hold both joysticks together. The player has 3 lives and one extra life is earned for each 30,000 points scored. The game has also a high score table.</desc>

		<name>Flight Simulator</name>
		<desc>The conception of the Flight Simulator computer game series, still going strong today, began in the late 1970's with "FS1", created by Bruce Artwick of subLOGIC and released in early 1980.  First came the Apple ][, with a very scaled down instrument panel on bottom and outside/radar view on top, then the TRS-80, with mere 128x48 monochrome graphics and thus numbers and bars replacing the panel.  

There was only one aircraft and one region: a 6x6 grid with "mountains".  The user could press "W" and "declare war", entering the WW1 "British Ace" game mode.  The objective was to shoot down enemy planes and bomb their base.

Both the Apple ][ and TRS-80 versions originally came on cassette tape.  The Apple ][ version was updated in 1981 with minor improvements.

Note that the first PC version, Microsoft Flight Simulator (v1.0), was released two years later and is more similar to the 8-bit versions of Flight Simulator II.</desc>

To reach the fortress, you will have to make your way through varied and dangerous terrain. Jungles, deserts, brush, and rocks all slow your progress, plus each area has numerous enemy fighters and tanks trying to stop you. To help get past these obstacles, you are armed with a machine gun and grenades; at some points in the game you may even come across an abandoned tank which you can control to increase your odds of survival. When you reach the end of the level and successfully destroy the fortress, the game will repeat at a higher level of difficulty. Gameplay is for one or two players, and four different skill levels are available.</desc>

There are an infinite number of stages to progress through.  Every third level is a "challenge stage" in which you have a free chance to shoot as many aliens as possible and rack up bonus points.

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships.  If that wasn't your last "life," you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower.

A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final "hit ratio"--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

Each room is one screen in size and are viewed from the side. Controls are simple with only two keys used to move the glider: backward and forward. Since the airplane naturally seeks the floor it is necessary to use the wind coming from floor vents to gain height. Obstacles that have to be avoided include tables, candles and electrical outlets. Good items to touch are clocks which give points and sheets of paper which give extra gliders. If touching any obstacles the glider is lost. The number of gliders available is by default four but can be set from one to six. </desc>

		<desc>Gofer no Yabou: Episode II (ã´ã¼ãã¡ã¼ã®éæã¨ãã½ã¼ãII lit. Gofer's Ambition Episode II) is a side-scrolling shooter developed and published by Konami for the MSX home computer in 1988. It was published in Europe as Nemesis 3: The Eve of Destruction later on the same year. The game is part of the long running Gradius series, and is a spin-off of the arcade game Gradius II: Gofer no Yabou. It is the second game of the series to be released exclusively for the MSX after Gradius 2. In terms of the story; the game is a sequel to Gradius II and Salamander. The game takes place almost 200 years after the crisis with Dr. Venom and James Burton has died in the year 6718.

		<name>Gozira Kun. Godzilla</name>
		<desc>Once the player gets past the title screen, the game will begin. The movement of Godzilla is in three dimensions, and Godzilla's only weapon is his atomic breath, which can be aimed. Godzilla has four lives, which are depleted by either the enemies touching Godzilla, hitting Godzilla with their attacks, or Godzilla falling into a hole.

Megalon will dig holes in the ground and come up to the surface to get Godzilla. After defeating Megalon, Kumongas will come up from the holes and fire at Godzilla with one of two weapons; a string shot or a color-changing projectile. After defeating several Kumongas, King Ghidorah appears and Godzilla has to defend Minilla. King Ghidorah shoots his gravity beams near himself, and if Minilla touches King Ghidorah, Godzilla loses a life. After defeating Ghidorah, the game restarts.

The 2-Player mode is the same as the one player mode except that two players can alternate between each life, each with their own lives and score meters. (godzilla.wikia.com)</desc>

		<name>Gradius 2</name>
		<desc>In the year 6664 Dr. Venom, the director of the Space Science Agency, was exiled to the planet Sard for his involvement in a failed rebellion and illegal scientific activities. One year later, he joined forces with the Bacterion invaders, escaped Sard, and took control of the space surrounding the planet Gradius. In 6666, the local government sends Colonel James Burton on the newest hyperspace fighter known as Metalion. The goal is clear: stop Dr. Venom and the Bacterion army before they conquer the planet.

Nemesis 2 (Gradius 2 in Japan) is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. The gameplay is for the most part similar to that of Gradius. The player-controlled ship can alternate between three main weapons: Missile, Double, and Laser. Extra weapons such as various types of lasers, napalm missiles, reflex ring, and back beam can be collected as power-ups and equipped. In addition, special power-ups can be acquired, their effects ranging from slowing down enemies to turning the Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount of time. Boss battles are followed by optional mini-stages, which grant the player new weapons if completed successfully.</desc>

		<name>Gradius</name>
		<desc>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot'em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of 'greatest hits' of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new.

The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here: collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields.

The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</desc>

There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters.</desc>

		<desc>Guardic is a top-down 2d shooter based on the classic premise of pitting a single starfighter against a horde of enemies with the fate of the galaxy at hand. A particularly interesting touch in Guardic is that instead of fighting through a scrolling field filled with enemies, the game places your ship in "rooms" with a fixed amount of opponents that take up the most part of the screen. After defeating every enemy on screen you advance to the next room and so on... Power ups are not activated until you reach the next room (with some exceptions) and even then you have to choose which ones to activate before you enter the fight, which gives the game an additional strategic touch.</desc>

		<name>Gulkave</name>
		<desc>Deviating slightly from Compile's usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox horizontal shooter. Flying across ? or inside ? a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you're granted bonus ships.

The game was released for both the MSX and Sega's SG-1000 console, the latter version having two levels less.</desc>

In the beginning of the game in a first person view the player has to be quick on the draw to shoot bags of money that fall down the screen, to collect a "bounty" that will be used to buy supplies and cover possible fines during the game.

The main game then takes place in an isometric scrolling play-field that is similar to previous Ultimate Filmation titles. The objective is to collect a bounty by finding and eliminating wanted criminals that are harassing the town. Innocent bystanders will point to the direction of the criminal, shooting them will result in a fine reducing your score. A horse can be obtained to speed up the chase. Once the wanted criminal is encountered, the game again switches to a first person cross hair view, where the first to draw will be the winner. Taking out the criminal will give you a reward that helps you with future expenditures as the cost of ammo and horses changes as the game goes along. Your final tally will become your score at the game's end.</desc>

		<desc>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</desc>

From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

		<name>Hole In One Special</name>
		<desc>After the huge success of the first two releases HAL Laboratory released a third golf simulation game. Again it is a standard 18-hole golf game, played from a top-down perspective.
Hole In One Special can be played  up to two players at three difficulty levels: average, expert and pro.
You can compete in stroke play, match play and tournament play. The tournament play can be set at one to four days.

During the game the following options can be changed: the direction of the ball, pick a club, set the curve of the ball and the stroke power.

The main difference with the other two releases in the Hole In One series for MSX is that Hole In One Special makes full use of the MSX2 graphical capabilities and can only be played on MSX2 computers.</desc>

Permanent logs and temporary turtles are used to get across the river, and reach one of the five home cells. After filling all of them the game moves up to a higher difficulty level. A range of keys can be used for each control function.</desc>

		<desc>You are Chumy, the mouse. You live in the sewer, and you are hungry. Luckily, the sewer is filled with cheese, only it is guarded by menacing creatures such as rabbits, turtles and bats.

In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level. Control Chumy with the cursor keys and X for jumping, C for throwing.

This game has also been included, in a slightly revised form, on Compile's Disk Station #0.</desc>

		<name>Hydlide II - Shine of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series.

In a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended. The people of Fairy Land were intoxicated with peace. At that time an incident occurred. A Consciousness filled with evil awoke and it created new monsters, brought the dead back to life, and wanted to dominate Fairy Land again.

The monks were one of the first who noticed this and warned the people about it but they didn't listen and left the monks disappointed. The monks prayed to God and asked Him if there was a Savior. God, impressed by the monks prayers warped the space-time of Fairy Land with the human world and selected an innocent boy who lived there.

The player controls the innocent boy, who must roam the lands of Fairy Land and free it from evil. The player has to create a character before beginning the quest, customizing his parameters - life, strength, and magic. As in the previous game, the player slays enemies by "bumping" into them or using magical spells. It is possible to change between attacking and defensive stances on the fly. The hero can become stronger and gain additional powers. In the villages there are shops where the protagonist can buy and sell weapons, armor, and items.</desc>

		<desc>An evil demon named Varalys casts a curse upon the princess Ann, turning her into three fairies. You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys.  Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.

Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to "bump" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.</desc>

		<desc>This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick's distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. 

The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot's energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.</desc>

		<desc>As a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards.</desc>

		<desc>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</desc>

The girl must have been touched by the hand of luck... and she alone is the only one who can save and take them safely back home.

You can move around in eight directions, trying to defend yourself against the attacks of creatures coming from the underworld.
You can defend yourself by means of scrolls with obscure magician runes, throwing cards and other weapons to be picked up en route.

The magic cards and magic spells have a limited range or last only for a short period of time but can be powered up by collecting the runes found after destroying a formation of red flames-shaped enemies or waving an black and white flag.
Several items (mostly pearls) will be found along the way and can be picked up and used to defeat the enemy creatures.

A round consist of multiple scenes (areas) and each scene is completed when the Scene Guard has been defeated and when a round is completed one family member will be free and return safely home...</desc>

		<name>King's Knight</name>
		<desc>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.

The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:

Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.

It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.</desc>

As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. 

The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</desc>

		<desc>Knightmare 2:Maze of Galious/Majou Densetsu 2:Daimashikyou Galious is a 
Japanese game which was released back in 1987 for MSX. It is a sequel to Knightmare. I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as 
Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The
sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both 
Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped 
by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.
You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same
time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items
to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge
and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</desc>

One day, you and your girlfriend are playing a game and suddenly get teleported into the game world. This is a fantasy world that resembles ancient Greek civilization. Before long you realize that you are in fact a hero who must save this world from the evil Gog, an ancient demon awaiting resurrection, otherwise you won't ever be able to return home.

Shalom is the third entry in Konami's Knightmare series. Unlike the previous games, it is much less heavy on action and is structured primarily like an adventure game with emphasis on interaction with characters and exploration. You navigate your hero through a large top-down world, interacting with characters along the way. The interaction is done via a command menu with verbs such as "Look", "Talk", "Take", etc. From time to time you'll have to fight enemies. The battles take place on a separate screen, and you attack the enemy with your weapons in real time.</desc>

To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.</desc>

		<name>Konami's Pooyan</name>
		<desc>In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  

The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.

The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</desc>

Of course, this won't be easy as each floor has many opponents to get past and a floor boss at the end of each level. 

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself. </desc>

		<name>Legendly Knight</name>
		<desc>Once there was only one continent in the world. It was populated by magicians. At first they lived in peace, using magic to make the land prosper. But soon they were divided into two groups: good and evil. The forces of vice were strong, and the benevolent magicians need the help of a lone warrior to venture into the castle of the evil magicians and defeat them.

Legendly Knight is a Korean-made action game with platforming elements. The game consists of single-screen stages, most of which contain platform structures. The player-controlled knight can jump and attack enemies. The goal is to kill all the enemies on the screen, including bosses which are fought one-on-one.

The knight has a health bar measured by hearts. He is armed with a small sword in the beginning, but later can find throwing weapons and magic spells. Items include armor, a scuba suit, health-restoring potions, and a ring that grants temporary invincibility. Keys must be obtained in order to access the boss room. All these items are invisible, and their exact location must be revealed by attacking spots in the stage. It is possible to find and equip glasses that would show the exact location of the keys.</desc>

		<desc>Les Flics (French slang for the police) is a game inspired by the movie and cartoon character The Pink Panther. With Unspecteur Cleudeau and Gend'armerie Kaolin on his heels, the player's task is to steal a priceless gemstone known as the Purple Puma.

The game starts out on the streets of a city with nine interconnected buildings. The player has to drive his car to the different buildings while avoiding the police cars that are chasing him. Upon entering one of the buildings the game switches to a side view perspective of a single screen platform stage. Each stage consists of five levels of platforms and the player uses staircases, lifts and firemen's poles to move between them. In the buildings are various objects that the player has to pick up since they are needed to steal the gemstone. There are nine items in total and it's up to the player to figure out what they do. At the same time the player has to watch out for the guards that try to stop him. </desc>

		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<name>Lot Lot</name>
		<desc>Lot Lot is a puzzle game. The goal of the game is of extreme simplicity. Manipulate the balls in such a way till they fall into the pits and generate points.

The game has five pits: Out, 0 points, 10 points, 30 points and 50 points.

Each level starts by giving the player a target score that has to be reached before the player can continue on to the next level.

The screen is divided into sixteen sections. The walls of those sections randomly disappear and the balls will then drop or roll into the other section or a pit at the bottom of the screen.

On the screen, there will be two arrows of which the second arrow follows the first one, but with a slight delay, and it stops at the same position as the first one.

The arrows will start in an empty section of which one of the walls will soon disappear. To move the balls to the empty section move the first arrow to a section that is filled with balls end press the space bar or fire button. The balls will then be moved to the empty section. If both sections contain balls then the balls will be swapped accordingly.

Now the goal is to manipulate the balls in such a way that they will  fall into the pits, thus generating points for the player.

In the bottom left of the screen there is a section that has a thin red line at the bottom. Never move the balls in that section because if any balls enter that section a crab will appear and cut the red line with its razor sharp claws, causing the balls to disappear in the pit labeled 'OUT' and resulting in the player losing a life.</desc>

Players control a Valkyrie fighter that launches from the Macross to rescue Lynn Minmay from the Zentradi. Many waves of enemies must be overcome by evading or shooting at them. A radar at the bottom of the screen displays incoming enemies and obstacles. As in the series, the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes, but cannot fire any weapons while transforming: in Fighter mode, it is fast and maneuverable. Speed and maneuverability are lower in Gerwalk mode, which can be useful for getting through tight spots. In Battroid mode, the Valkyrie's projectiles are self-seeking. Only in Fighter and Gerwalk modes, the Valkyrie can launch a powerful missile spread that can take out a lot of enemies at once. The spread is limited to three firings per wave, though. </desc>

		<desc>The Eggerland series consists of several puzzle games. This game is a sequel to Eggerland Mystery. Again you play Lolo, a blue ball-like character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only she is red. Again it's up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him. You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). All the rooms are connected but not all the room entrances or exits are closed.
To fight the monsters Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers. There are numerous types of obstacles in the rooms. Emerald Framers are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely. To make it all more challenging there are also numerous terrain obstacles, like water, sand and grass which have all different drawbacks for Lolo.</desc>

		<desc>Near the end of the 20th century, a small fortified nation named Outer Heaven (founded by a mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. 

In order to fulfill this objective, the player must collect various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront bosses in the form of Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to increase player rank, which gives Snake an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.</desc>

At the beginning of each round the labyrinth floor is shortly visible, giving you the opportunity to locate the keys and the vault in the labyrinth. After a few seconds the labyrinth turns black. Only your direct surroundings of the labyrinth lightened.

Now it becomes your goal to collect all the keys, open the vault with the collected keys and then return to the middle of the labyrinth to enter the door and go to the next floor.

There are at least three hostile green men running around in the labyrinth who are trying to catch you. You'll loose a life when they catch you.</desc>

		<desc>This is a simple, top-down simulation of minigolf. Do not expect any of the extravagancies found on some luxury minigolf park; this is more in line with what can be found on a camping ground in the middle of nowhere. The entire course encompasses 9 holes.

Using joystick or cursor keys, a white dot representing the club is moved around a black dot representing the ball. This indicates angle, and the distance from the ball sets the putting force. Putting the ball in the hole in as few strokes as possible is your objective: less than 8 strokes gives higher scores and more than 12 strokes yields no points at all.</desc>

The Rainbow Nebula is home to that last kind, and the protagonist of the game is the only one who can fight them.

Mirai is a sci-fi shooter with strong role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist who uses a jetpack to fly through scrolling maze-like environments. Experience points and money are gained from defeating the numerous respawning enemies. Money can be used in the few friendly areas to purchase weapons and items. The player also has to keep an eye on the fuel gauge for the protagonist's jetpack.</desc>

		<desc>The famous detective Sir Charles Foxworth is taking a holiday on the Mississippi with his servant Regis on the Delta Princess. He's just taking a stroll around the upper deck of the ship when he discovers an open cabin door. Behind it: a dead man. As it turns out, the body of Raleigh Cartwright III. Sir Charles has three days to find the murderer, because then, the ship will reach New Orleans, giving the culprit a safe chance to escape. The joystick controls the player's sprite to move into the respective direction, and pressing the button opens a menu with appropriate commands for the current situation. Walk around, Inspect an item, or examine evidence. You will meet some characters who also happen to be suspects. Use these encounters as a fact-finding session. Take notes on what he or she has said. Share these notes with other passengers and crew members. But your first job is to find the body. Until you do, any information you gather will be of little value. Once you find the body, the other passengers will prove to be much more talkative. Collect as many notes and evidence as you can to solve the mystery. Once you think that you have it solved, make an accusation by going to the character that you want to accuse and by using the joystick, point to Talk to [character's name], and press the joystick button. Then point to Accuse [character's name] and press the joystick button. Depending on the amount of evidence collected, you will know if your hunch was right or wrong. Murder on the Mississippi has four possible endings with many variations on each one. Don't let the Delta Princess arrive to New Orleans before you solve the mystery, or the murderer will get away.</desc>

AKA: Secret Treasure of Moai

In The Secret Treasure Of Moai your goal is to reach the level exit at the top by climbing and destroying the rock structures before you run out of time or got caught by enemies.

The rocks can be destroyed with the hammer that you carry. When destroying rock formations you might find special items and you should collect these or otherwise you might end up being unable to reach the level exit. You also won't reach the end of the level if you destroy the wrong rock structures or destroy them in the wrong order. As you progress in the game the puzzles to reach the exit become more challenging.

The game contains bonus stages in which you have to collect as much diamonds as you can within the time limit. (Moby Games)</desc>

Three difficulty levels are on offer: Selections, Children and Experts. Your mole, while digging tunnels in the earth to collect each and every item on-screen before proceeding to the exit, can neither jump nor dig upwards, which is what makes careful planning of your tunnels necessary. To your aid, you have a map screen which shows the entire level in a zoomed-out format. The same screen is also used for the built-in level editor.</desc>

However, the color of the mallet changes frequently and the player has to respond to it because hitting a mole of the same color as the mallet will result in decrease of the score bar. If the player is unable to fill the score in time (indicated by a timer bar), the game is lost. There are 9 difficulty levels, with higher difficulty featuring more frequent appearance of moles of the same color as the mallet, thus requiring more attention of the player.</desc>

		<name>Moon Patrol</name>
		<desc>Moon Patrol is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate "stage" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. 

Dangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. 

After completing the first course (the "Beginner Course") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course. </desc>

Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

		<name>Mr. Do! vs Unicorns</name>
		<desc>Mr. Do! vs Unicorns (AKA Mr. Do!'s Castle) is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles.

There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life.

The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous. (Moby Games)</desc>

		<desc>Between the Seas of the Seven Islands and the purple Mountains lies a valley. Time was that this area was safe and hospitable, however darkness then came - killing many of the inhabitants and warping the minds of the others. Many have gone there, none have returned - can you be the first?

Nightshade is an arcade adventure in scrolling isometric 3D (an advance on earlier Ultimate titles such as Knight Lore, which were flick-screen), with directional or rotational controls. You can take 3 hits from the various roaming monsters - turning from white to yellow to green as you take them - but a 4th costs you one of your five lives. Objects can be thrown at these foes, but only if you have any.

The map is made up of medieval-style buildings, which are visible while you are on the outside but whose roofs lift when you enter them, to ensure full visibility. There are four super-villains to destroy (a mad monk, a skeleton, a ghost, and Mr Grimreaper), and you must find the right objects to do this.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<path>./Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Ninja Jaja Maru Kun</name>
		<desc>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. 

Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.

In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.

As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.

Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.

The items in this game are:Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.

Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!

Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.

Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.

Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.
Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!

Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.

Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Kun - Ashura no Sho</name>
		<desc>The game tells another story in Ninja-kun series. This time itâs a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually wonât kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, youâll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.

Ninja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.

The levels (called âscenesâ in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels youâll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.</desc>

		<desc>Far, far into the future, inter-planetary archaeologist Vick XIII, makes a choking discovery. The pyramids on earth are malfunctioning devices of alien origin with enough energy to destroy earth. And it's up to Vick to switch off the core functions of El Giza.

The game consists of six pyramids each with its own wall engravings and color pattern; every pyramid contains 10 levels. The idea of the game is to collect crystals called soul stones in each level by solving the different puzzles and evading or killing the enemies using the many tools and weapons available to unlock the exit door that will take you to the next level.

The game was released both for the MSX1 and MSX2 systems. The MSX2 version only saw a release in Japan. The MSX 2 version was the same game except minor changes like the music was remixed and some of the items and backgrounds recolored.</desc>

		<desc>Pachicom is a pachinko game simulation. Pachinko can be described as a game that is a cross between pinball and a slot machine. This game comes with two different game modes to play. Game A lets the player play until they attain a score of at least 3000. The goal is to achieve this score as fast they possibly can. Though, the game can still end prematurely by running out of balls to shoot. Game B lets the player try to get as high of a score as possible, but with an added time limit.

The game contains over 200 different board layouts to choose from. At the main menu, just choosing Game A or B will randomly assign a board for the player to play on, while choosing Select A or B will let the player select their own board of choice to play on.

The gameplay is mainly passive. Players can only adjust the shooting pressure knob which effects the speed and location of where the balls will land.(Moby Games)</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-Man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now shown in isometric perspective and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision! </desc>

		<name>Parodius - Tako ga chikyuu o sukuu</name>
		<desc>The first title in the Parodius series, although it is often confused with its sequel Parodius! From Myth to Laughter. The name itself is a portmanteau of "Gradius" and "Parody" and, eponymously, the game is a parody of the Gradius series of space-based horizontally scrolling shooters. Many of the characters and enemies are derived from that famous shooter series, while other elements are extracted from other Konami titles, such as Antarctic Adventure and TwinBee. This game is of particular note in the series as being heavily infused with Japanese culture and folklore.
The gameplay is very similar to the Gradius games, with other aspects from games such as TwinBee. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games as well as Japanese culture. The music is mostly taken from classical music pieces.

The player can play as either Takosuke, an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as moai. As with Gradius, the game utilizes a similar selection-bar based power-up system.</desc>

		<name>Pastfinder</name>
		<desc>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. 

At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.

Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.

The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points. </desc>

Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.

Pippols is a vertically scrolling shooter in which you take control of a lad who navigates what seems to be a garden and shoots hearts at enemies. The screen is divided into five vertical paths by rows of flowers (or other shrubbery and obstacles in later stages). Within the path the protagonist can move freely up and down, but to change the path he needs to jump left or right if there is an opening. You can collect coins and various power-ups as you go. At the end of a stage you can choose one of the branching paths to advance to a different stage.

		<name>Pitfall</name>
		<desc>Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!</desc>

		<desc>Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

		<path>./Puzzle Panic (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Puzzle Panic</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Panic is a 1984 puzzle game created by Ken Uston in collaboration with designers Ron Karr, Bob Polin, and Paul Wernick. Ken Uston was better known as a blackjack player and strategist, but he was also a video game author and the creator of Puzzle Panic. The game was originally released on the Commodore 64 and Atari 400/800 in 1984, but later received an MSX port in 1986 by SystemSoft.

Puzzle Panic is more of a minigame compilation than a defined puzzle game. There are eleven different "levels" that can be played, each of which is somehow a pattern based short puzzle game. These range from collecting certain items in a specific order, to reaching a set point under certain conditions.

The player begins the game in a room filled with question marks. There are two doors available, and walking into each one teleports the player to a new game (while the other brings the player to a new room, with two different doors; essentially a hub world). Within these games, there are several modes of difficulty to play through (accessed through three different doors within each game) before moving onto a different screen. All of the games can be accessed at anytime by bringing up the menu (by pressing F2).

When the games are played in order rather than by the menu selection, they are (in reality) part of a larger puzzle, where each puzzle is actually represented by its own symbol, and interaction with the gates at the end of each is integral. In fact, the final puzzle requires the player to select the symbol that represents each level, as well as the order they were played in sequence. The final puzzle was known as "Metasequence," Ken Uston's "ultimate challenge." This larger puzzle was originally intended to be part of a real life contest, where players who managed to complete the puzzle in time (by August 31, 1984) won a trip to Atlantic City with Ken Uston.(Giant Bomb)</desc>

		<name>Replicart</name>
		<desc>It is the 22nd century. Earth is invaded by a aliens, led by a gigantic robotic snake. To repel the attack, Earth's scientists construct the Replicart machine, a deadly robot snake. The player takes the role of the pilot of the Replicart.

Replicart is a single-player only Snake game variant. In each of the 300 stages you have to collect a certain amount of a substance called 'Biteslime'. Once you fulfill your quota you can enter the next stage through an exit that opens on the left side of the screen. Collecting biteslime increases the length of your snake. If the head of your snake hits a wall, an enemy or part of its body you lose a life.  Replicart enhances the basic Snake game formula by adding power ups like a Time Stop, which freezes enemies, speed increase/decrease or level warps.

The Famicom Disk System version has undergone a few changes. There are only 100 stages and after each 10 stages you have to face a boss, which must be shot down before continuing to the next set of stages.</desc>

		<name>Rise Out from Dungeons</name>
		<desc>Rise Out From Dungeons is a platform game where you must guide an unnamed character through 20 dungeons avoiding traps and red-colored men. The graphics and game mechanics are strikingly similar to Lode Runner, but with a twist.

As in Lode Runner, you must collect several objects all over the level while avoiding red-colored men, there are many stairs and gaps where you fall down if you are not careful. If you fall in the water, you die. You can also destroy blocks by shooting them with your gun. Curiously enough, the "red men" can't be defeated by your gun, and they will follow you everywhere you go, only to respawn if they reach a point where there's no way out. There are some elements which look like ropes but they are in fact just a special kind of platform: you can always walk across them safely, but if you land on them after falling down, you will just fall through them, so they actually work as traps. Other game elements include a hidden key used to open a door which leads to the stair leading out from the dungeon.

The objective in each dungeon is simply to "rise out" from them, and that can be done by climbing a stair which passes through the dungeon ceiling.

The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you.

The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life. </desc>

Six robots from six countries fight in a tournament that, apart from the robot element, is closer to American, Mexican or Japanese wrestling than the classic kind of wrestling. Each player uses three keys or buttons to execute various attacks in the classic "button masher" beat'em'up manner, with different button combinations triggering different techniques according to the proximity between the combatants. Each robot has its own arsenal of special moves. The ring is viewed from an elevated position and allows movement in two dimensions. The losing robot is turned into scrap ready for recycling, with the winner going on the next round.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<name>Sasa</name>
		<desc>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. 

The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</desc>

		<desc>Players take control of Demon Kogure, a member of the real life Japanese heavy metal band Seikima-II. He is on a mission to rescue his fellow "demon" bandmates who have been captured and imprisoned by the God Zeus.

The game is broken up into four zones that are composed of eight areas each. In each area players have to collect all the visible items laying around to complete that area. Once all the items are collected in the seven areas of a zone, players can then enter the eighth area where they will find one of their bandmates locked inside a cage. While collecting all the visible items, players will be continuously attacked by enemies that they can either try to jump and dodge or shoot their projectile weapon at them. Getting hit by an enemy will decrease the players life, which is already constantly draining.

One of the items the player collects are moneybags. Collected moneybags earn the player money which can in turn be spent at the various shops found throughout the game. Shops sell life potions, stronger weapons, and also musical instruments for each band member.</desc>

Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system.
Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.
Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.

The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. 
Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water.
Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way.
Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.

On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more.
The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer.
The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</desc>

		<name>Shindobaddo Nanatsu no Bouken. The Seven Adventure</name>
		<desc>As Sinbad the pirate, you have not been successful recently, and there is mutiny brewing among your crew. The only way to appease them is to find your father?s buried treasure, hidden underground on Corinthia. Trogs and Soldier Ants heavily guard the island, but you have your trusty sword to help. Make sure your food and water levels stay high enough by regularly checking your status.

Viewed from a first-person view, Sinbad must navigate the building in single steps, moving in the current direction or rotating each time. Each of the 54 rooms has a pattern on its door giving some idea of its function. Some are empty, but many contain either objects or hazards (though there is no clue as to whether it is an object or a hazard). Objects include a Compass, a Bag of Gold Coins, a Treasure Chest, and the Magic Lamp, and are automatically collected. The hazards are either a magnet (damaging your compass), Trogs (who are defeated by checking the letter on its shield and pressing the appropriate letter key to jab him with the sword). Soldier Ants are scared into submission (using your torch) in the same way, but they will still lurk menacingly. The third type of room is a Clue Room, which requires the Magic Lamp, and sees you gain a hint from the Wizard.

There are six skill levels ? not only do they increase the number of Trogs and Ants, they also change the letter you must press to defeat them. The position in the alphabet of the killing key is the value of the letter displayed, plus the skill level (so if you see H on level 3, press K, for example.

		<name>Shiryou Sensen. War of the Dead</name>
		<desc>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...

Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down "world map": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. 

The goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.</desc>

		<path>./Slapshot (Spain).zip</path>
		<name>Slapshot. Hockey sobre hielo</name>
		<desc>Slapshot is an aggressive online street roller-blade hockey game without any principles and rules on the rink. Each game-player logs in and tries to raise his/her level as much as he/she can, playing numerous matches, winning the money, raising their stats, and buying equipment and skills.

There are three kinds of hockey players: Defender, Centre Forward, and Wing Forward. Each of them may be male or female, and they differ by stats. Defender is strong, but slow, while Wing Forward is fast, but not strong. There are 13 stats for each player, which may be raised with level increases and/or with clothes worn or items used.

There are three stages of the game:

1) Tutorial;

2) 1-5 Levels; 

3) 6-50 Levels

During Tutorial stage, you'll learn basic techniques and some tricks available with certain levels.

During 1-5 Levels stage, you may play in 2 kinds of matches:2 human players versus 2 bots
2 human players versus 2 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to 6th, and the ability to earn money if you run out of such on the third stage.

During 6-50 Levels stage, you may play in 3 kinds of matches:1 human player versus 1 human player
2 human players versus 2 human players
3 human players versus 3 human players

It is a stage to increase your level to maximal and become the legend of Slapshot.

Each player may create the room for the rink, adjust its theme, invite others, dismiss unwanted players, protect the room with a password, etc. Winning the money, you as a player may spend it on clothes, which increase your stats, or items such as clubs. Money also may be spent on the skills, which you'll use during gameplay by pressing combination of keys defined for such skill. To master the skill, you may practice in a separate rink.

The hockey gameplay itself is in 3rd person view, while you move your player with arrow keys, and use defined keys to hit the puck, hit the opponent, steal the puck, speed up, use command options, ask a team player for a pass, give a pass  to team player, get ready for a strong hit before a pass, etc. Additional skills allow you to hit the puck sliding left/right, turning in 360 degrees, get out from opponents, hit the puck sliding around the gates, etc. Animation sequences are shown using the game engine, when the match starts, finishes or somebody scores.

During each match some players may have some additional missions (for example to interrupt the pass for 2 times), which gives more money on accomplishment. Tactical and technical actions are calculated for each player during the match and their number and quality influences on experience player gains after the match's end.

Chatting before, after and during the game is possible and allows to understand the desires and mood of each game participant.</desc>

		<name>Space Camp</name>
		<desc>Based on a special effects movie, Space Camp takes place in space (it says so in big letters on the cover). You guide your spaceship through orbit, avoiding meteor showers, military satellites and other obstacles. The control method is much like "lunar lander" type games, but in zero gravity, so a quick thrust with the engines will move the ship indefinitely. Since you have limited oxygen and energy reserves, you must pick up oxygen bottles and energy canisters from the space stations you fly past.

After the vertically scrolling space sequence, you jump out the ship and explore a space station. The control method is the same, and like before, you must keep an eye on oxygen and energy. Apart from said resources, the space stations have hidden treasures hidden below certain panels. Find treasure by gliding across the panels and pushing the joystick button. Certain panels will lead you to hidden treasure chambers. All the while, you must watch out for the space station's guardian, which moves in your direction when you activate your thrusters or press the button. As long as you just glide, the guardian stays put.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision (see Battlezone  and Asteroids).  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

		<name>Space Trouble</name>
		<desc>On the surface, Space Trouble looks like an orthodox shooter, but it has an unorthodox twist: Don't shoot! You navigate your ship through an asteroid field, with a finite fuel supply. From time to time, enemy ships come into view and try to hunt you down. Shoot them down, but bear in mind that each shot costs a little bit of fuel. Sometimes, you will encounter a fuel supply, and strewn throughout the game are powerups which boost your "flight record", which is turned to score as you complete a level. As the game progresses, the asteroids change into other obstacles, such as flying saucers, mines and organic blobs which take several shots to kill. Each enemy ship also has its own movement patterns, some hunting you down, some avoiding your shots, and some just bumbling straight forward. 

When you've passed four different fields, you encounter a mother ship. Docking with the ship requires minute precision, or you will crash and die. The ship teleports you to the next level, which is much like the first.</desc>

		<name>Star Command</name>
		<desc>Star Command is a sci-fi role-playing game set in a vast fictional universe and featuring tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI's Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.

The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called "The Triangle" due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain "Blackbeard", the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.

The game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity. Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you're lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.

Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer's school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.

After you have created your crew, it's time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you're now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship.

While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).

While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire. Some situations, for example when you're boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.

One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events. There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.</desc>

		<name>Star Virgin</name>
		<desc>Star Virgins about as obscure as it comes, its a promotional hour long straight to video film from Japan. That was made to promote a little seen videogame of the same name distributed by Activision that only ever appeared on the long forgotten msx system.

Plays out pretty much like a bonkers live action anime movie. Its a camp science fiction fantasy comedy about a girl whose secretly the lone fighter of justice Star Virgin, its her pursuit to stop the planet being attacked from robotic &amp; puppet monsters, giant spiders and whatever else would warrant as being an end of level boss in an 80s video game... at least I think thats the overall idea, because its obviously never been translated into English its hard to totally fathom out what the hells going on, but hey thats the beauty of the Japanese movies right.

Star Virgin herself is every Japanorama fanboys wetdream, shes a cute pink power ranger with her own spacecraft &amp; powerbike and she kicks ass with a bazooka. The whole thing would have made an awesome music video for The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (what I'm oddly playing while writing this). Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.

[Personal Reasons For Remembering]
Really loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.</desc>

		<desc>The third entry in Zemina's unlicensed conversions of early Super Mario Bros. games differs from its predecessors by having its own levels. While the two first games imported levels of their correspondent Mario counterparts, Super Boy III does not copy the stages of Super Mario Bros 3.. Instead, it utilizes elements from previous Mario games as well as Super Mario World, from where some enemies and level design ingredients are borrowed.

Unlike those two games, however, Super Boy III  has completely linear levels that must be traversed in a particular order. There are no special levels such as castles, no familiar bonuses, and no power-ups besides those that were introduced in the first Mario game. Mario also walks and runs significantly slower than in Nintendo games. At the end of each stage Mario has to defeat a Hammer Brother.</desc>

The levels resemble those of the original game, most notably the earlier ones; however, only outdoor areas and simplified castles (some without any enemies except Bowser) are included. The game ends after three worlds, each divided into three stages and a castle level.

This version omits much of the material found in Super Mario Bros.. There are no power-ups except the mushroom (which is placed randomly); no warp points; no bonus levels; no cave or underwater areas. Falling platforms replace elevators; pipes cannot be entered. Castles can be completed without defeating the guarding Bowsers. In the castle's final area the player is greeted by the words "Sorry Nothing". The princess is not mentioned at all.</desc>

		<desc>Super Cobra is a side-scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</desc>

An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.

The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</desc>

		<name>Super Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan after the original arcade games release.  55 stages were culled from these arcade games and were packaged into Super Lode Runner for the Famicom Disk System. The game also kept the innovation from the arcade games of the two-player mode and brought in 15 stages for simultaneous action.

The game keeps the typical gameplay of the Lode Runner series. Players have to collect all the gold on the stage, while either avoiding or trapping the robotic guards who are constantly giving them chase. The game also features a level editor so players can create their own stages to play on.

A few months after this game was released, Super Lode Runner II was released which is similar to this game, only it included different stages from the arcade games. Also, this game shouldn't be confused with the MSX game with the same title. While in a similar situation as this game, it contains an entirely different set of stages to play.</desc>

		<name>Super Pierrot</name>
		<desc>This game is the sequel to Mr. Do's Wild Ride and the fourth title in the "Mr. Do!" series. You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched.
To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus.
On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.</desc>

The game is a big maze where you need to find objects, primary amongst them seem to be bottles of different colours. The game is laggy, in particular when wielding your weapon. Enemies in the first couple of screens don't seem to do you any real harm. You can kill them typically with a single hit, and you can even walk over them. Killing enemies gives you experience (EXP), and when your experience bar is full your life bar increases (H.P). After a few screens though the enemies suddenly get a lot tougher and can kill you almost immediately.</desc>

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.(Moby Ganes)</desc>

		<desc>In most games you have to attack monsters as a hero. In this case you are the reincarnation of the creature of Dr. Frankenstein. The opponents, however, remain monstrous. Mon Mon Monster is an arcade platform game with some touches of adventure. With your monster, you have to make your way through a maze of screens. Your path is blocked at all times by boulders and annoying creatures. The action takes place over the entire screen with the exception of some information at the bottom. In the fields you can find lots of useful objects such as "rocks", the normal method of defeating an opponent is simply done with the fire button. With this you reach the effect of a punch stroke or when you are standing at a distance, you shoot a projectile. You throw the boulders using a combination of the stick and 2nd fire button. Not really easy but practice makes perfect. You can also find extra life or supplement the remaining energy. Even secret passages are not lacking in this game nor are difficult passages such as water fountains. With a press of the STOP key you pause the game and a card is also placed on the screen. On that card you can read your current posfty as well as the screens you have already viewed and also the position of the Boss is indicated. However, this card does not help you much, since you still have to reach your goal through secret passages. I have not yet finished the first internship. Have you lost all your lives you can continue to play through a continuous option. However, you will still start at the beginning of the internship, but items that have been retained will be retained. Mon Mon Monster looks graphically well-cared for The music is welcome, thanks to the fact that the musical possibilities of the FM-Pac are used. The movements are smooth and "Frankie1" lets you steer well The idea is not very interesting, but still fascinating.</desc>

		<name>Thunder Bolt</name>
		<desc>Thunderbolt is set in the future and is about the war between humans and the planet Proxima. Both experiment with chronoclasm bombs which has the ability to destroy items from the future or past. Unfortunately a big accident during a trial run causes the space-time continuum to collapse. The immediate consequence for the player, manning a Thunderbolt jet fighter, is that he has to fight his way through enemies from different decades.

The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter with the basic promise of flying from left to right without getting destroyed. Helpful are the two weapon systems: the unlimited standard attack and a special attack which causes every enemy on the screen to die. Every hit and touch with the environment causes the players fuel reserve to decrease. The latter is important because there are many structures which can only be passed with precise positioning.</desc>

The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. 

Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. 

The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</desc>

		<desc>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.

Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:

    Yellow: grants bonus points;
    White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;
    Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);
    Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;
    Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.

The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.

One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.

In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</desc>

		<name>Ultra-Man</name>
		<desc>In the future, Earth must protect itself from alien invaders, a task handled by the Science Special Search Party. However, they are not alone in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.

Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</desc>

An easy task, if it weren't for the enemy attack waves. Most waves consist of planes flying in a straight line across the screen, without even shooting at you. Others bounce across the screen, and some are more dangerous, as they are flying in intricate patterns and firing multiple shot. Of course, you can fire back, but keep that at a minimum. The power bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by your cannon, and when it has reached zero, your firing rate is very low. After a while, a route comrade will join you as a kind of power-up. When a third plane joins, you may merge your fighters into a flying robot.</desc>

Destroying the enemy warroid will give the player one point on the six-point scale (the player starts out with three points each). When all points are lit in the player's color, the player wins the game. Controlling the warroid is easy, since it will always point its gun towards the enemy droids. Just push the space key to shoot a lot and jump away from the line of fire. There are multiple platform-like levels for the player to fight in.

A menu (called up by pressing the escape key) will let the player customize the game so as to set handicap and the colours of the player's warroids.</desc>

		<desc>Woody Poco is a side-scrolling action role-playing game similar to Mystical Ninja.

The player controls an old wooden figure named "Poco." He is a hero who has lived in harmony with humans for many years. For Poco, the journey is to find the fairy who teaches people to get back to being friendly with wooden dolls. Enemies encountered through the game are strange creatures and bothersome old men. The player attacks by using his fists at them. Players can steal the items in the store. But after stealing, the player's appearance is changed to resemble that of a thief. Hotels and pawn shops can no longer admit the player for the remainder of the game after a theft has taken place.

The player can equip one hand with a weapon, and the other with a passive tool, such as a lamp for dark areas. The player can buy gear, sleep at hotels, gamble, steal, and bribe non-player characters. The player needs to eat to prevent hunger, with recharging health based on food level. It features an in-game clock, with day/night cycles and four seasons; the color changes to reflect the time of day and the season.</desc>

		<desc>Xevious: Fardraut Saga is a vertically-scrolling shooter that contains two modes: Recon and Scramble. The Recon mode is a port of the arcade game Xevious; the Scramble mode can be considered its sequel, adding sixteen new stages, enemies, and boss battles, as the brave fighter pilots continue to defend the Earth against its former inhabitants, who migrated to the planet Xevious thousands of years ago and are now determined to re-capture their ancestral homeland.

The game's Scramble mode allows the player to control three other aircrafts in addition to the seris' trademark Solvalou, each possessing unique weapons. These aircrafts include Solgrado (armed with spread shot), Zeodalley (twin back fire), and Gampmission, a large ship that is also a combination of the previous three, with massive firepower and enhanced lock-on abilities. A specific aircraft can be assigned to each of the player's "lives". The amount of points needed to gather an extra life increases if the player selects more powerful ships. Also, enemies become progressively harder as the controlled aircraft collects power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</desc>

It was released worldwide in 1982, however, after obtaining a license for Buck Rogers, western versions of the game became known as Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom. Both Zoom 909 and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom are largely the same game minus some minor graphical differences.

Though most home ports of the game are based on Planet of Zoom, Zoom 909 was brought to the Japanese MSX in 1983 and SG-1000 in 1985. These versions take more liberties with the formula, introducing a top-down stage as level 3.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear</name>
		<desc>Near the end of the 20th century, a small fortified nation named Outer Heaven (founded by a mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. 

In order to fulfill this objective, the player must collect various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront bosses in the form of Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to increase player rank, which gives Snake an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.</desc>

Aliens: Alien 2 is an arcade platformer (or run'n'gun if you like) featuring Ripley on a planet infested with aliens. Armed with only a basic gun at first, she faces facehuggers that come out of alien eggs. After having dispatched a face hugger, the egg may be shot to reveal an item. Items may be hand grenades, stronger guns or wing items which make her jump longer. For some reason, the planet is infested not only with aliens and their offspring, but also with snakes. After clearing the surface level, Ripley enters a complex where the first boss, a giant, full-grown alien resides. The following level takes place within the complex.</desc>

		<name>Akumajyo Drakyula</name>
		<desc>You are young Simon, who has just entered Dracula's Satanic Castle.
The world of Dransylvania is in trouble, and you are the one to set it right. You have to fight your way through 18 stages of demons to where Dracula is hiding. Once you have destroyed Dracula, the evil force behind all the trouble will show up, attempting to destroy you! Destroy this menace, and Dransylvania will return to it's happy days after a wait of hundreds of years.

Vampire Killer follows the same plot as Castlevania, but with a different gameplay. At each stage, Simon has to find a white key to open the exit door which leads to the next stage. The keys are usually hidden in the castle's walls, in which he will also find useful items. Items can also be found by whipping candles and other sources of light inside the castle.

Among the items which can be found are:
Gold Cross: wipes out all enemies;
Silver Cross: prevent enemies from appearing for a short time;
Sapphire Ring: renders Simon invincible for a short time;
Blue Crystal: renders Simon invisible for a short time;
Yellow Key: is used to open chests containing items;
Candle: highlights destructible walls; 
Map: can be used up to three times and shows Simon location n the castle;
Red Book: increases item's prices;
White Book: decreases item's prices
Tan Shield: blocks enemy attacks;
Red Shield: reduces damage upon enemy contact;
Boots: make Simon walk faster;
Wings: make Simon jump higher;
Holy Water: a secondary weapon, which uses hearts as ammunition;
Hourglass: stops enemy movement for a short time, consuming hearts.
Hearts are both a kind of ammunition and currency in the game. They can be found by whipping candles or killing enemies. They are used for buying items from the Old Crone and as ammo for the Holy Water and the Hourglass.

Simon can also find several primary weapons in the game, such as whip upgrades, a throwing dagger, an axe and a cross. Differently from Castlevania, the dagger, axe and cross replace the whip and do not use hearts as ammo.</desc>

		<path>./Ganbare Goemon! - Karakuri Douchuu (Japan).zip</path>
		<name>Ganbare Goemon</name>
		<desc>The second game in the Ganbare Goemon series (known in English as Mystical Ninja) and the first released on a video game console and home computer. It was initially released for the Family Computer July 30, 1986[1] and later released for the MSX one year later.
The game revolves around the main character, Goemon, and his exploits. As the name suggests, his character was based on Ishikawa Goemon, the noble thief of Japanese Folklore. Unlike its sequels, this game still doesn't feature the comic situation and strange characters that define the series, and Goemon is portrayed as a noble thief rather than a plain hero.[2]

The game plays a top view action/adventure game (similar to The Legend of Zelda) though it is separated by stages. In each level Goemon must find three passes in order to advance. Some of these passes are found in boxes, secret passages or can be bought. After finishing all the stages, the game will present you with a new Japanese province (eight total), but all the levels will remain the same. The ending, however, will be different.

Like the rest of the series, Goemon can be powered up if certain items are found and/or bought, which can be lost after a few hits.

The MSX version has the option to be played in turns by two players, with the second player playing as a ninja named Nezumi KozÅ, which is the basis of Goemon's sidekick Ebisumaru. In addition, unlike the Family Computer version, the game has six more provinces with completely new levels after finishing the game once.</desc>

		<desc>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

		<desc>Track &amp; Field is a sports game that allows the player to have an experience based around the Summer Olympic Games. Events include the 100 meter dash, the hammer throw, the javelin throw, the long jump, the high jump and the 110 meter hurdles.

The MSX version replaces the hurdles with a 400 meter dash.

The Famicom version loses the hammer throw and the high jump, but the NES version restores the high jump while adding skeet shooting, the triple jump and archery as events. The NES version also keeps the 110 meter hurdles and forgoes the 400 meter dash.

If the player wants to go to the next event or round then they will have to qualify, by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum distances. This game contains a two player option, in which the players take it in turns.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear 2 - Solid Snake</name>
		<desc>In 1999, a great scientist named Kio Marv invented "oilix", a special petroleum-purifying substance that was supposed to help in the upcoming oil crisis. Shortly after the invention became known in the world, Dr. Marv was abducted. An investigation showed that he was held captive in Zanzibar Land, an isolated state in Central Asia which was ruled by a group of mercenaries from all around the world. Having oilix in addition to nuclear weapons are bound to Zanzibar an invincible state that would sooner or later attempt to conquer the entire world. Roy Campbell, ex-commander of special unit FOXHOUND, sends Solid Snake, the man who has single-handedly brought down the military nation of Outer Heaven four years ago, on a mission to infiltrate Zanzibar and to bring back the scientist and his invention.

Like its predecessor, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake is a stealth game. The driving element of the gameplay is to stay unnoticed. If guards spot you, you don't have much chance in combat, unless you are armed with appropriate weapons, which aren't easily acquired. Snake can use a variety of weapons and gadgets to help him survive during his mission. He can also hide behind objects, punch guards, and crawl. From time to time he'll have to participate in boss battles, where stealth won't help any more.</desc>
