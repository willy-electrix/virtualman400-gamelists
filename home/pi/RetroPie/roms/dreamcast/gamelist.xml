		<desc>The 4th edition of Bust-A-Move adds some great new characters to choose from, as well as a Story mode, where you win Tarrot cards from each puzzle you complete. Player VS. CPU has two different modes: Story mode sees a story unfold as you defeat each CPU character (and changes depending on the character you start with) and Win Contest is a simple "how many games can I win in a row" against the computer. Finally, if you complete the Challenge mode (where you must complete certain puzzels as fast as possible, and get judged on technique, speed etc.) the Edit mode will become available. In here you can put together your own puzzles for you or your friends to complete.</desc>

		<name>Carrier</name>
		<desc>Carrier is the first survival horror game released for the Dreamcast.  As the game starts you are Jack Ingles, a member of a special forces team.  You are sent in by Helicopter to investigate a carrier that has not been responding to radio contact after completing a mission. As you approach the deck of the carrier, your helicopter is shot down.  After crash landing on the deck, it is your job to investigate what exactly is going on, and escape alive.

The game is played from a third person perspective.  You move Jack around the ship, shooting enemies and solving simple puzzles along the way.  The main goal of the game is to survive, so you have to be careful about conserving ammo and health upgrades.  After you solve the game playing as Jack, you can play through the game again as Jessifer Manning, one of your teammates.  While playing as Jessifer, you get an entirely different view of the same story.</desc>

		<path>./Charge 'N Blast (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Charge 'n Blast</name>
		<desc>Charge 'N Blast is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth of alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you weapons to blast them away.

There are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods).

You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.

Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.

You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.

		<desc>Coaster Works puts the player in the role of a roller coaster engineer, recently hired to help construct several different roller coasters for different amusement parks.

The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.

After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.

There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.</desc>

		<name>Evolution 2: Far Off Promise</name>
		<desc>Evolution 2 is a direct sequel to World of Sacred Device. The events of the game take place six months after the conclusion of the previous game. Mag Launcher, the son of a great adventurer of the past, has earned the title of "best adventurer" in the town Pannam. The adventurer guild (called the Society) sends him to the south, to the large town Museville. Mag has to explore the surrounding dungeons, performing various archaeological quests for the Society.

The game is more like a second chapter to the first Evolution than an actual sequel. You control the same party of characters: Mag, the cute girl Linear Cannon, the butler Gre Naid, and the adventurers Chain and Pepper. The dungeons are randomly generated. In those dungeons, you can find rare artifacts you can later sell, and special weapon enhancements called "CyFrame", which can upgrade your characters and teach them various techniques.

The US version of Evolution: Far off Promise features original Japanese voice-acting with English subtitles.

Defend your base against the initial incursion by manning turret, tank, helicopter, harrier jet, and even captured alien fighter as you battle the aliens in various continents, and eventually lead the counterattack on the moon!

Incoming is a 3D shooter with plenty of action. In arcade mode, you can play it as a straight shooter. Some missions have you manning an immobile turret where you simply aim at the sky and engage incoming bogeys. Other missions can have you control a ground hovertank engaging enemy ground threats. Yet other missions will have you control a helicopter, a Harrier jumpjet, and even a captured alien fighter. There are also an "action" mode and "action-tactics" mode, where you are given some limited control of other friendly units.</desc>

They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.

Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</desc>

The game features 22 anime-like Characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world - except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D-bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it's not possible to fall of the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called "plasma moves", visually very appealing special moves filling the complete screen which can be executed when you have collected enough "plasma power". Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters.

		<desc>Project Justice is the sequel to Shiritsu Justice Gakuen: Nekketsu Seishun Nikki 2. It once more thrusts you into the shoes of a team of students, trying to find out what is causing all the bizarre events.

Players pick a school to fight for and smash their way through the other schools, questioning them until you find out what is happening. The gameplay is very similar in style to the original Rival Schools, featuring bombastic special moves and team-up attacks, along with the same, highly caricatured students.</desc>

		<name>Psychic Force 2012</name>
		<desc>Psychic Force 2012,  the sequel to Psychic Force,  is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.

Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.

The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.</desc>

		<name>Re-Volt</name>
		<desc>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! 

Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. 

There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. 

In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</desc>

		<path>./Shenmue (USA) (Disc 1).chd</path>
		<name>Shenmue</name>
		<desc>That day in November when the snow turned to rain. Ryu Hazuki arrives home just in time to see his father killed by Lan Di, a man Ryu's father obviously knew very well. Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father's murder as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.

Much of Shenmue's gameplay involves talking to Ryu's friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but the vast majority of items you can buy have no purpose outside of filling out your inventory screen. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play arcade accurate versions of  Hang-On and Space Harrier as well as games like darts and pool.

Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight, sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training, or by sparing with his friend Fuku-san. Fighting plays like a simplified Virtua Fighter game, although with toned down air juggling. Ryu's training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing an input prompt is not always fatal, but whether Ryu survives or not depends on the danger he was in.

Included with the game is the Shenmue Passport disc. On this disc players can receive tutorials about various aspects of the game like minigames or the battle system, watch cutscenes they've already seen in the game, and listen to music from the game. This disc also includes the option to go online to a special site where players can review world-wide minigame rankings, get hints for the game from Nozomi, review game maps of Yokosuka, trade uncommon items found in the game for even rarer items only available on the passport, and visit the official homepage. This service went offline along with the rest of SegaNet, and all online features are currently impossible to access.</desc>

		<path>./Spider-Man (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Spider-man</name>
		<desc>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.

Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.

This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.

Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.

Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.

Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.

There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</desc>

		<path>./Striker Pro 2000 (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Striker Pro 2000</name>
		<desc>European soccer game based around the UEFA license.  Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license. 

UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.

The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.

In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:

Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams.  In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice.  The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams.  The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.

National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests.  Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way.  This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result).  The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals.  Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded.  The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward.  The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.

National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers.  The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once.  The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals.  Penalty shootouts settle ties.

Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.

8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition.  The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.

Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.</desc>

		<desc>In Super Magnetic Neo, a gang lead by evil, foul-mouthed baby Pinki has taken over Pao Pao Park.  The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.

The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums.  Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.

You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.

There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick.  It's something like the VR missions in the Metal Gear series.</desc>

Vampire Chronicle is, in fact, a collection of all 18 characters and 4 different play modes available in the whole Vampire (Darkstalkers) series.

The originality of this game lies on the possibility of controlling monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.

The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.

The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.</desc>

		<desc>In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.

D-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos.</desc>

		<name>Dino Crisis</name>
		<desc>Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.

Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.</desc>

		<desc>In the World of Giga Wing, many wars have been fought for the divine stone Medallion. Entire civilizations were destroyed in the struggle for gaining control of the legendary item. Now, in the year 2050, four pilots have set off, each carrying a mysterious stone. The stones are said to be the only way to destroy Medallion once and for all. The player can choose to complete the journey for any of the four pilots.

Giga Wing is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up. Up to two players must steer their planes around enemy bullets and destroy everything in their path with only a limited amount of lives. When tapping the A button, the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.

Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.

There are two game modes, arcade and score attack. Arcade plays just like the original coin-op game, and score attack lets the player choose a stage and fight for the highest score there. In this mode, the player has unlimited lives, however the score multiplier will reset once the player dies or uses a bomb.

		<desc>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder.  In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.

The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the "boost" power-ups that lie around the tracks.  Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.</desc>

The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players.  The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire.  The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</desc>

You play as one of three cops, in this beat-em up fighting game from Sega.  Dynamite Cop features similar gameplay to Die Hard Arcade. As your character enters an area, you have to beat up everyone there.  Once they are gone, you continue to the next area.  To help you there are many weapons, such as guns, knives, pepper spray, chairs, and bread.  Bread?  Yes, you can use pretty much anything as a weapon.

		<desc>Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.

The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.

Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.</desc>

Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching, switching to different views after the ball is hit.  The famous limitation of World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders until after the ball is fielded!  For this reason the game was almost universally panned by reviewers upon its release.  This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the World Series Baseball franchise.</desc>

		<desc>Zero Gunner 2 would on first inspection appear to be a bog-standard 2D shooter. However this import game actually has a bit of a unique "spin" on the shooter genre.

Most noticable, all backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique "target and spin" feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative.

The usual power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.</desc>

		<desc>A futuristic sci-fi shooter in which you play a test pilot strapped to the brand new RAIN combat simulator which allows you to remotely control fighters as they immerse themselves in the midst of enemy territory.

The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship and try to survive the onslaught of enemy attacks while you attempt to clear the levels. Weapon upgrades are based on collectible power-ups, but the game mostly relies on a power bar that fills as you destroy enemies and which allows you to unleash your super weapon at the expense of decreased normal firepower. The game also features a unique "border" system which involves three separate routes through each stage. You select the default route at the start of a level and when your ship is destroyed you get knocked down to the next "border", which features alternate backgrounds and enemy patterns. Only if you get knocked off the last border you lose the game.

Uses completely polygonal graphics and features single player arcade, remix and practice modes through 6 enemy-infested stages, the last of which has four unique variations.</desc>

Three agents, Stick Breitling, Linda Rotta and Rikiya Busujima, who have come together from various paths of fate, now join together to do battle against the army of the undead and rid the streets of the zombie scum!

The game features multiple weapons and 1 or 2-player arcade action. Each of the characters have different attributes, agility, strength, better with weapons as opposed to unarmed combat. 

There are a multitude of weapons that can be found through the game such as shotguns and machine guns to battle the undead. There are a range of attacks that can be performed, charging your shot by holding down the button longer, variable shots by locking on the zombie longer, rolling attacks, backward and dash attacks and more.

There are a number of game modes accessible from the main menu. The Arcade mode from the coin-op version, an Original Dreamcast version, which gives you options of playing the game with more focus on either weapons only or bare knuckle fighting. There is also a vs Boss and Fighting mode, as well as a Training Room.

Zombie Revenge also features downloadable mini games for your VM unit. There is a Zombie Revenge Raising Game where you feed and raise your own zombie. Playing the above mentioned Original mode provides food items for your zombie.
The zombie you have raised can also be uploaded to the Internet, or emailed to someone, and other peoples zombies can be downloaded.

There are two other mini-games: Zombie Fishing (fish for zombies) and Zombie Doubt (memory test with symbols).</desc>

There are four characters to choose from, each with his own storyline and fighter/spaceship. Each ship has its own weapon type and speed.

Like the previous Giga Wing and Mars Matrix games, gameplay is designed around bullet absorption/reflection mechanics, large numbers of enemies, and giant boss fights. Giga Wing 2 adds the ability to choose from two different bullet reflection powers: reflect force and reflect laser. The reflect force repulses enemy shots, while the reflect laser uses them to charge up a beam weapon.

The game is set in an alternative universe's World War II, where the players pilot the newest machines of war - prototype helicopters. While the gameplay is fairly typical for a vertical shooters, Under Defeat innovates by allowing players to tilt their vehicles slightly left and right, changing the angle of their fire.
The game was available in two different editions - a regular version, and a collector's edition pack that included a soundtrack CD. Unlike most Dreamcast games which traditionally shipped in a jewel case, both versions of Under Defeat came in a DVD-sized keep case.</desc>

		<name>Ikaruga</name>
		<desc>Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to Radiant Silvergun by Treasure, on the Sega Saturn.

Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black &amp; white sides of his ship during gameplay.
The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. 

This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</desc>

		<name>Dux</name>
		<desc>DUX is a scrolling shooter in the vein of R-Type. When scientists searched for new materials to enhance their space ships, they discovered a new and powerful material they dubbed DUX. Since this type of material proved unstable, nobody except the player seemed brave enough to fly the space ship constructed from it. The player's job is to lead the ship through a series of horizontal levels against the Spiritual Spacers "to reach the obvious."

The player's ship has a standard laser shot that can be upgraded or changed for x-ray and bounce shots, which are very similar to the weapons in R-Type. The player also has a pod that protects them from enemy bullets and that can be launched as an offensive weapon in a move called "dash." Keeping the fire button pressed will launch a more powerful hyper shot.

To score points, the player can destroy chains of enemies in quick succession or soak up chains of bullets. Hyper Soaking makes the player invulnerable to bullets, but drains the Obvious Energy gauge if not enough bullets are soaked in or new energy orbs are picked up. The player wins the game if they manage to beat all the bosses at the end of each level. If they are hit by a bullet or collide with their surroundings, a life is lost. After all lives and continues are depleted, the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Toy Commander</name>
		<desc>Some of the greatest adventures that kids have growing up occur in their imaginations as they play with their toys.  Toy Commander is a game that attempts to capture these adventures in an interactive, three dimensional world. The player's perspective is that of the toy vehicles that inhabit a house. The various gameplay areas are all based on rooms in this giant house. 

Gameplay in Toy Commander is mission based.  In each mission, you control one or more toy vehicles to accomplish certain objectives. The objectives in each mission vary widely.  In some missions, you must drive an army truck and shoot things, in some you fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some you must race against computer controlled vehicles. 

There is a story line that ties together the missions in single player mode. A coalition of old toys has started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy Commander, is leading this rebellion.  It's your job to stop him. In each mission, your basic goal is to complete the task in as short a time as possible.  If you meet a certain time goal, the mission is completed.  By completing 4 missions, you get to challenge the Boss character in the room.  If you successfully destroy the boss, he will assist you in the final fight against the Toy Commander.

In addition to the single player mode, there is a 4-player simultaneous deathmatch mode.</desc>

He is not helpless in his battle against the odds however. He has brought along to this strange dimension Super-Cyp, his heroic alter ego, into whom he may change temporarily using the power-ups scattered around the levels.

		<name>Unreal Tournament</name>
		<desc>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it's now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3. 

At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point. 

The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it's called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.

All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots.  Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</desc>

		<name>Tech Romancer</name>
		<desc>Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling one of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd (A huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office building with wrecking ball for another) to the "typical" anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest gem, detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with heavy cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you're bound to find at least one which suits you.
The gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you'll no doubt be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups).
The game controls consist of two attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works pretty much the same as any other special bar - once it's full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off a special move. There's an armour bar, which depletes as you take or block certain hits - if it runs out then you'll start taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and there's also the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are picked up from the battlefield or stolen off the enemy).
The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is completely different for each character and, for most characters at least, branches many ways, often with multiple endings depending on choices made and targets met. 
To put it simply, this is a quirky pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Confidential Mission is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series.  You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.

The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players.  The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire.  The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</desc>

		<name>Cosmic Smash</name>
		<desc>Cosmic Smash for Dreamcast is a port of the Sega Rosso arcade game. It is a futuristic sports game, a mix of squash and Breakout.

The player controls a semi-transparent human male in third-person view. The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit.

Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.</desc>

		<desc>On July 29, 2010, the city of Saronica comes under attack by an army of monsters called the SMO as they lay siege to the city, capturing it and ruling the populace under an iron fist.  During this, The Resistance is formed in an attempt to stop the SMO, lead by a woman by the name of Lily who is kidnapped when she attempts to help a man by the name of Kou.  After she is captured, it is learned the man has come into possession of two ancient pistols by the name of "Crimson" that can destroy the monsters and their vicious leader.  Kou sets out with Lily's daughter, Yuri, to bring her back and stop the evil forces within the city.

Death Crimson is a light-gun game similar in style to House of the Dead where the player shoots at enemies that pop up on screen and save innocents from the monsters.  The player can also power-up the "Crimson" pistols by shooting death flowers that will turn their firepower into machine guns to decimate hordes of enemies.  There is also a health meter that will increase in size by successfully shooting enemies, gaining experience points.   Once enough points are obtained, the health bar will increase, however missing enemies or shooting civilians will take away points.</desc>

All characters have weapons and distinct fighting styles with over 100 individual moves per character.  In addition to high, mid, and low attacks, characters can hold/throw, block, and perform special attacks -- one or more of which is deemed "un-blockable" and must be avoided by ducking, jumping, or rotating around your attacker. 

In addition to several locales in which to fight and alternate models/costumes per character, the Dreamcast conversion of Soul Calibur contains many additional features over the arcade coin-op, including hidden characters and locales, a campaign mode, and tournament mode.  There is also a "museum" where you can view character profiles and view motion-captured martial arts demonstrations.</desc>

		<desc>In Super Magnetic Neo, a gang lead by evil, foul-mouthed baby Pinki has taken over Pao Pao Park.  The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.

The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums.  Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.

You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.

There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick.  It's something like the VR missions in the Metal Gear series.</desc>

		<path>./Tetris 4D (Japan).chd</path>
		<name>Tetris 4D</name>
		<desc>Tetris 4D is a fairly standard Tetris game that was released in Japan shortly after the Dreamcast launched.

The game features two modes, Classic and Battle. Classic mode offers a normal solitaire Tetris game: rotate and fit falling blocks to complete lines. Five difficulty settings are available, which change the speed and piece preview settings.

The sound and graphics generally follow a modern urban/industrial theme, with five techno music choices, including a variation of the classic Tetris "Karinka". The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as you advance in levels.

The Battle mode offers two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player. Difficulty is set independently allowing for handicaps.

Unfortunately, you can't play the battle mode against the computer. There's also no VMU support for saving high scores, a rather critical omission for this type of game.</desc>

		<name>Ikaruga</name>
		<desc>Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to Radiant Silvergun by Treasure, on the Sega Saturn.  Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black &amp; white sides of his ship during gameplay. The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast.   This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</desc>

		<path>./Rainbow Cotton (Japan).chd</path>
		<name>Rainbow Cotton</name>
		<desc>Another shooter in the Cotton saga. Trouble brews in the homeland of Cotton's long time friend Silk, as the evil demon Suede steals the legendary Willow candy from the queen's castle. Seeing as how no one can face Suede and his forces Silk drafts Cotton in order to restore peace to her land, but she may have forgotten that Cotton is a big fan of Willow candies herself...

Gameplay-wise Rainbow Cotton actually follows in the steps of Panorama Cotton as the gameplay switches from a 2D perspective to a 3rd person one. The gameplay itself however is reminiscent of games like Panzer Dragoon, in which you don't control Cotton as she flies, but instead where she aims with her magic spells. You can shoot down enemies as well as open chests, doors and other bonus locations for power-ups and spells, which advance Cotton's abilities in an rpg-lite fashion and increase your arsenal with different magical powers.

Taking advantage of the technological advances, the game uses for the first time polygonal graphics and to complement the action the game features 2D animated cutscenes between levels.</desc>

		<name>+☆Fast Striker</name>
		<desc>Fast Striker is an arcade-style vertical shooter with a science fiction setting. While the game is essentially 2D, the backgrounds consists of pre-rendered 3D graphics. This game features six stages with over 40 enemy types.    You can choose between 3 game modes (Novice, Original and Maniac) with different scoring systems. The modes differ, for example, in the set of available techniques. In comparison to the Novice mode, the Original mode features a shield to protect the ship, which can be activated for a short time, and holding the down the spread fire button will also shoot rockets after a few moments. Furthermore, the enemies are colored differently in Novice mode to make them more visible, and you collect golden stars as part of the scoring system. The Maniac mode adds some new ways to get higher scores. For example, the distance between your ship and an enemy influences the score: you get a larger bonus the nearer you are to the enemy ship when you destroy it. Destroying many enemies in short time will also increase the number of awarded points. Last, you can activate a "Grind Mode" by focusing your ship's laser beam on a huge enemy. The beam will turn green after a while and then all destroyed enemies will give a higher score.</desc>
