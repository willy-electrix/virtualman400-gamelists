# virtualman400-gamelists

See https://github.com/willy-electrix/virtualman400-fixes (fix #3) for more info.

Cleaning in progress. Done so far:

* prevents ES from crashing when turning "parse gamelists only" on
* restores 20 games that weren't showing up in collections
* removed games with missing path left over from development --- count now 12,110 whether "parse gamelists only" is on or off
